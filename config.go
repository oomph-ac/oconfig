	// AllowSwitchInputMode is a boolean indicating if the proxy should allow players to switch their input mode, or if it should enforce one input mode to be used unless the player re-joins the server. This can primarily
	// be used to prevent players from using exploits that switch the input mode to touch only when enabled to obtain a combat advantage. This option is recommended to be set to false.
